Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2023.
- Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
- Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable
applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application
withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
- Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.
- Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.
- If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.
- Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered “first-time students” for fall
enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.",,,,
