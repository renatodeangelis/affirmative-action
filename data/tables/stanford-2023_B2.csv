B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institutionʼs official fall reporting date or as of October 15,
2023.
1. Include international students only in the category ""Nonresidents.""
2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons
who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under ""Two or more races.""
4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: ""Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other
eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA
and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.""
5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at
https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.
6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does
not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be
reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.",,,,,,
