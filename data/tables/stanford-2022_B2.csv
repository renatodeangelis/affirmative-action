B. ENROLLMENT AND PERSISTENCE,,,,,,
"B2 Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category.
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institutionʼs official fall reporting date or as of
October 19, 2022.
• Include international students only in the category ""Nonresidents.""
• Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
• Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the
Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only
under ""Two or more races.""
• New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
• Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
• Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States
(including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of
high school graduation.
• Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa
or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other
eligible noncitizens in this category.
• NOTE - Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven
racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.",,,,,,
