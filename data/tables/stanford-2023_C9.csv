"If necessary, please use this space to clarify your test policies (e.g., if tests are recommended for some students, or if tests are not required of some
students due to differences by academic program, student academic background, or if other examinations may be considered in lieu of the SAT and
ACT.)
For the 2023–24 admission cycle, Stanford did not require ACT or SAT scores for first-year or
transfer applicants. For the 2024–25 admission cycle, which has an entry term of Fall 2025,
Stanford will continue to be test optional and will not require ACT or SAT scores for first-year or
transfer applicants. Stanford is committed to a holistic review of all applicants. We consider the
vast array of information provided in and with each studentʼs application, whether that includes
test scores or not.

C9. First-time, first-year profile: National standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)
Provide information for all enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including
students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements. Report the
percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.
1. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
2. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized test
results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
3. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
4. If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
For example: If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from
the other). If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.",,,
